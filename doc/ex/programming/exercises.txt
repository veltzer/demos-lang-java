Java Programming exercises

Basic syntax
============

Lab 1
	Create an array of 100 integers.
	Fill it with random values in the range [1…1000].
	Hint:  the following line retrieves a random integer within the scope [0… N-1]:
	int  r  =  (int) ( N * Math.random());
	Calculate the average of the array contents and print it out.

Lab 2
	Change the program so that main would receive parameters for the array size and the values range. 
	Hint:  the following line retrieves an integer from string
	int  r  =  Integer.parseInt(String);

OO Concepts
===========

Lab 1
Create a class Customer according to the following specification:

	Customer
	name: String
	id: String
	age: int

	Customer()
	Customer(name:String, id:String, age:int)
	getName(): String
	getId(): String
	getAge(): int
	setName(name: String): void
	setId(id:String): void
	setAge(age:int): void

Lab 2
Create a class Account according to the following specification:

	Account
	id: String
	balance: double

	Account(id: String, balance: double)
	getId(): String
	getBalance(): double
	deposit(double amount): void
	withdraw(double: amount): double

The withdraw method should return the balance after withdrawal. 

Add the following to class Customer:
A class member of type Account.
A Constructor that gets all parameters, including Account.
The methods setAccount & getAccount.

Java class definition
=====================

Lab 1
	Add to the class Account the field - typeOfAccount : int (with a setter and a getter).
Create two final fields: CHECKING_ACCOUNT=1 & BUSINESS_ACCOUNT=2  to validate the type of the Account.
Use a static field to create Account id sequence.
Remove the id parameter from Account constructor and use the sequence instead.

Lab 2
Create a Singleton Bank according to the following specification:

	Bank
	bank: Bank static
	customers: Customer[]
	index: int

	Bank()
	addCustomer(customer:Customer): void
	getCustomer(index:int): Customer
	getNumofCustomers(): int
	getBank(): Bank static

Note: A singleton object class insures that only one instance of the class can exist at any given time. This is done by hiding the constructor (by making it private), and using a static method to handle the insanitation of the object. Here is a sample singleton class:

	public class Singleton {
		private Singleton() {
		}
		static private Singleton _instance=null;

		static public Singleton getInstance() {
			if (null==_instance) {
				_instance=new Singleton();
			}
			return _instance;
		}

Inheritance
===========

Lab 1
Put the classes Bank, Customer & Account inside the package meta.bank.
Add to the class Account a final field named COMMISSION of type double. Change the withdraw method to add commission for each withdraw. The method's return value should now return the actual amount withdrawn, including commission.
Add to the package meta.bank a class named BusinessAccount that extends the class Account.
Override the withdraw method, so that a BusinessAccount may be in overdraft. Create AMOUNT_PROTECTION final field that holds the limit for the overdraft.

Lab 2 
Change the class Customer according to the following specification:

	Customer
	name: String
	id: String
	age: int
	accounts: Account[]

	Customer()
	Customer(name:String, id:String, age:int)
	Customer(name:String, id:String, age:int, account:Account)
	getName(): String
	getId(): String
	getAge(): int
	getAccount(index:int): Account
	addAccount(): Account
	setName(name: String): void
	setId(id:String): void
	setAge(age:int): void

Modify the Test class. Add iteration over the customer array. For each customer, withdraw 6000 and print his balance. While iterating, find and print the value of AMOUNT_PROTECTION.

Abstract classes
================
Change the class Account to abstract according to the following specification:

	Account
	id: String
	balance: double

	Account(balance: double)
	getId(): String
	getBalance(): double
	setBalance(balance: double): void
	deposit(double amount): void
	withdraw(double: amount): double abstract

The withdraw method should return actual amount withdrawn after commission. 

Create a class CheckingAccount that extends the Account class according to the following specification:

	CheckingAccount
	COMMITION: double (constant)

	CheckingAccount(balance:duoble)
	withdraw(double: amount): double

Change the class BusinessAccount to extend the class CheckingAccount.

Create an interface Business according to the following specification:

	Business interface
	addCustomer(customer: Customer)
	getCustomer(index: int): Customer
	getNumOfCustomers(): int

Change the Bank class to implements the Business interface.

Exception Handling
==================

Change the withdraw method to throw an OverdraftException For the CheckingAccount when the balance is under 0 and for BusinessAccount when the balance is under – AMOUNT_PROTECTION.

Collections
===========

Modify the class Bank. Change the customers field type to List. Fix the methods addCustomer(Customer), getCustomer(int) & getNumOfCustomers().

Modify the class Customer. Change the accounts field type to List. Fix the methods addAccount(Account), getAccount(int) & getNumOfAccounts().

Multi-Threading
===============

Create Runnable class called AddCustomer. If the number of the customers in the bank is under 50, the run method will try to add a customer to the bank. (Iteration until 100).

Create Runnable class called RemoveCustomer. If the number of the customers in the bank is positive, the run method will try to remove a customer from the bank. (Iteration until 100).

Create Test class that created two AddCustomer threads and two RemoveCustomer threads.

IO
==

Lab 1
Create a file origin.txt with text.
Use BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream to copy the origin.txt file text to copy.txt file text.


Lab 2
Create a Test class that writes and reads the bank object.
Use the .ser file.

Networking
==========
Create a simple chat program (One client sends a message to the server and all the clients see it).
Client
Create a ChatClientFrame instance for a Graphical User Interface, and invoke its init() method.
Note: the actionPerformed method belongs to an "event listener" (not to be confused with a socket listener!). This method will be invoked when the client presses the “Send” button, or types Enter.
Use the ChatClientFrame methods: String getMessage() & void addMessage(String).
Wrap the socket inputStream & outputStream with DataInputStream & DataOutputStream.
Modify the thread main to try to always read a message from the server and add it to the GUI.
Use the actionPerformed to get a message from the GUI and sent it to the server.
Don’t forget to close resources.

Server
Create thread main that always tries to accept a client.
Run thread for each client. Each thread will try to read from the client and than write the message for all the clients.
Don’t forget to close resources.

JDBC
====
Create table with the fields: name String & id Number.
Add 3 people to the table: “Yossi” 1111, “Pasi” 2222, “Moshe” 3333.
Select the rows with id that is bigger than 2000.
Print the result.

Notes
=====
1. Exercise about inner classes is missing. Make one up.
2. Big exercise (abstract and interfaces) is attached (StorageSystems).
