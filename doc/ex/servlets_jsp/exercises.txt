Exercise 4 – Simple Form Processing
Exercise description:
Write a Servlet that consists of a simple HTML form, which includes the following fields: First
name, Last name, ID and Email. When the user submits the form, a POST request is sent to the
Servlet, the Servlet reads the parameters from the request and sends them back to the client as an
HTML table.
Exercise directory:
<exercises>\servlets api\
Files to use:
\exercise\FormServlet.java
Run:
http://localhost:8080/02-servlets_api/form
Exercise 5 – Numbers Guessing
Exercise description:
Write a simple number-guessing game using a Servlet. While initializing, the Servlet creates a
random number between 1 and a defined maximum value. The user is asked to guess the number.
If the guess is too high or too low, a proper message is displayed. If the guess is correct, a "You
are a winner" message is displayed.

NOTE: The user can make only one guess, after which the result is printed out. For each request
a new random number is generated.
The Servlet should read the defined maximum value from the ServletConfig object, which is
passed as a parameter to the init method. Add the needed element to the web.xml file.

03-Cookies and Session Management - Exercises
Exercise 6 – Cookies Servlet
Exercise Description:
Write a Servlet that stores cookies on the user’s computer. The user enters the name and value of
the cookies in an HTML form and submits them to the server. The Servlet reads the parameters
sent by the user and adds a new cookie to the client according to the parameters. The server
prints the cookies it receives in each request.
Exercise directory:
<exercises>\cookies and sessions\
Files to use:
\exercise\CookiesServlet.java
Run:
http://localhost:8080/03-cookies_and_sessions/cookies
Exercise 7 – Logging in using a Cookie
Exercise Description:
Write a Servlet containing a Login form with two fields (Username and Password). When the
user logs in, he can mark a “remember my user name” checkbox for future log-ins.
The Servlet stores the user name in a persistent Cookie (saved forever), and uses this Cookie for
the next log-in to welcome the user back to the application (the user still needs to enter his
password in order to login).
Exercise directory:
<exercises>\cookies and sessions\
Files to use:
\exercise\CookieFormServlet.java
Run:
http://localhost:8080/03-cookies_and_sessions/cookieForm
Exercise 8 – Shopping Cart
Exercise Description:
Write a shopping cart Servlet, based on HttpServlet. The Servlet will create an “Items list”
(inventory) that the user can buy and stores it in the ServletContext. The user is allowed to add
items from the inventory to his shopping cart, which is practically a list stored in the
HttpSession. The Servlet shows the shopping cart’s content and the total price of all the items on
the cart.

04-Using Databases with Servlets - Exercises
Exercise 9 – Shopping Cart using a Database
Exercise Description:
Write a shopping cart Servlet, based on HttpServlet. The Servlet reads the available items in the
shop from a database table. The user is allowed to add items to his shopping cart. The Servlet
shows the shopping cart and the total price of all the items on the cart.
The design is based on the Data Access Objects (DAO) design pattern. The database is a
Microsoft Access database used with a Jdbc-Odbc bridge driver.
Create an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN) named "CartServlet" that will point to the .mdb file
(located in the Database directory of the exercise).

07-JSP and JavaBeans - Exercises
Exercise 13 – HTML Table Helper Bean
Exercise Description:
Write a JSP that uses a special JavaBean to draw HTML tables. The bean is called TableHelper
and gets two parameters for each table: A two-dimensional String array (containing the table’s
data) and the table’s background color. The html property of the bean returns the needed HTML
code.
Exercise directory:
<exercises>\Jsp and Beans\
Files to use:

Run:
http://localhost:8080/07-Jsp_and_beans/tables.jsp
Exercise 14 – User Creation
Exercise Description:
Write two JSPs that handle the creation of new users. The first JSP is a simple HTML form with
four fields (First name, Last name, ID and Email). The second JSP gets the request parameters
and creates a User bean. It then calls the User.validate() method to validate the First name and
Last name (Which must not be empty). The validate() method uses the JSP error page
mechanism to an error, by throwing an Exception if a validation error occurs.

Exercise 22 – JSF Calculator Screen
Exercise Description:
Create a JSF calculator. The application's screen should look like this:
In other words, an input box and five buttons. Make sure all components have proper IDs,
including the form itself.
Exercise directory:

Exercise 23 – JSF Calculator Content
Exercise Description:
Now, update the calculator to work properly:
•
•
•
•
Define a Backing Bean that will allow you to retrieve the value typed by the user.
Define action listener methods, and wire them to the five different buttons.
The backing bean should maintain the original value, so it can perform the calculation based
on the previously-remembered value and the previously-entered operation.
The calculation result should be stored as the display value.
For example, if the user types in "13" and clicks "+", the backing bean should remember the "13"
and the "+". Now, if the user types "16" and clicks "+", the display (input box) will be updated to
"29".
Ignore operator precedence issues; i.e., if the user types "13", "+", "16" and clicks "*", the
displayed result will be "29", and this will be multiplied by whatever the user types next.

Exercise 24 – JSF Calculator, Continued
Exercise Description:
Add a link to the calculator; the link text should be "Scientific mode".
When clicked, a set of new buttons will appear, for square-root and power-of-two. These are
image buttons. In scientific mode, the link itself will change to "Standard mode" (see image).
When "Standard mode" is clicked, the new buttons will disappear.
There are several possible ways to add or remove the two buttons:
•
•
•
•
Define them in the JSP file, with the rendered property set to false. Toggle the
rendered property when the link is clicked.
Define them in the JSP file, with the style property set to "display:none". Change the
style property when the link is clicked.
Do not define them in the JSP at all; add them to the component tree in the Java code
which handles the link.
Define them in the JSP inside a container, such as <h:panelGroup>. Toggle the
rendered or style attributes of the panel group rather than of each individual button.
The link itself should change its text when clicked, but it should not be replaced with a different
link object (i.e., do not define two link objects, one visible and the other invisible at any given
time. Use a single link that changes its caption).

Exercise 25 – JSF Validation
Exercise Description:
In this exercise, you will use both a validation method and a validator object.
First, add a validator object to the input box, for ensuring that it is a numeric value. Use the
double-range validator, and specify the Java constants Double.MIN_VALUE and/or
Double.MAX_VALUE. Also make sure that the field is marked as "required".
Next, add a custom validator method to the action which handles division. If a division-by-zero
operation is attempted, display an appropriate error message.

Exercise 26 – JSF Navigation
Exercise Description:
In this exercise, a navigation and login system will be added to our calculator application.
We will create 3 new screens; the links from one screen to the other must all be based on the
navigation system.
1. The homepage will contain some simple "welcome" text.
2. The help page will contain a brief help text.
3. The login page will ask the user for a login name and a password.
The fourth screen remains the calculator screen developed in the previous steps.
The user login status should be maintained using a cookie. If the user is logged in, then the
homepage will redirect immediately to the calculator page. Otherwise, the homepage will display
a link to the help page and a link to the login page.
The login page will include the usual username/password pair of fields. For simplicity, the
program should accept any password that is identical to the login name. If the login is successful,
the calculator page will be displayed; otherwise, the login page will re-display itself, with an
error message, prompting the user to retry.
The help page will contain a link titled "Enter", which should lead to the calculator page if the
user is logged in, or to the login page if the user is not logged in.
Exercise directory:
<exercises>\ JSF-Calculator\
Files to use:
homepage.html – contains the text that should appear in the homepage (without the links, etc.)
help.html – contains the text for the help page (again, without the required links).
